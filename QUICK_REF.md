# ⚡ QUICK REFERENCE - Cost Optimizer Demo

## 🎯 ONE-LINER PITCH:
*"I built a cost optimizer that analyzes your ML code and tells you if you're overpaying for GPUs. Stable Diffusion example: saves $4,380/year by recommending T4 instead of A10."*

---

## 💰 KEY NUMBERS (Memorize These):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SD VRAM Detected | 9GB |
| Current GPU (A10) | $0.90/hr = $7,884/yr |
| Recommended (T4) | $0.40/hr = $3,504/yr |
| **Savings** | **$4,380/year (55%)** |

---

## 🚀 COMMAND TO RUN:

```bash
cd example-stable-diffusion
PYTHONPATH=../src python3 -m brev_launcher.cli cost-estimate
```

---

## 💎 VALUE PROPS (What Makes This 10/10):

1. ✅ **Automatic** - Scans code, no manual input
2. ✅ **Quantifiable** - Shows exact dollar amounts
3. ✅ **Actionable** - Clear recommendations
4. ✅ **Real Value** - Saves actual money
5. ✅ **Differentiating** - Nobody else has this

---

## 🎬 IF DEMO FAILS:

Backup talking points:
- "It detected Stable Diffusion v1.5 in requirements.txt"
- "SD v1.5 needs ~6GB, plus 50% buffer = 9GB"
- "T4 has 16GB, plenty of headroom"
- "A10 is 2.25x more expensive for this workload"

## ⏱️ TIME CHECK:

- **1 hour 20 mins left** before demo
- Feature is DONE ✅
- Script is ready ✅
- Just need to record 📹

## 🔥 GO TIME!

**Record the demo. You got this.** 💪
